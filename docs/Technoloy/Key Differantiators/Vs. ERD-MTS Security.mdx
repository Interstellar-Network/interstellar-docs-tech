# Redefining Endpoint Security: Interstellar’s Next-Generation Defense

Recent security alerts from Binance regarding the rise of clipper attacks—where malware alters cryptocurrency wallet addresses during transactions—highlight the growing sophistication and mass scale of state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). With additional recent warnings from Microsoft Security and the FBI, it's clear that APTs are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure, financial services, and blockchain ecosystems, driving the need for stronger, more resilient security solutions, especially on mobile.

Interstellar was built to respond to this escalating threat with a decentralized security layer designed to manage transactions between humans and their devices. Our vision is to achieve information-theoretic security, potentially securing even communication to the human brain through the eye. While we aren’t there yet, Interstellar is already capable of countering the most sophisticated attacks without the need for traditional Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.

## A New Category of Endpoint Defense

Interstellar represents a completely new category of endpoint defense, distinct from the EDR systems that many organizations rely on today. Unlike EDR, which is limited on mobile devices and struggles with system-level monitoring, Interstellar leverages a decentralized architecture that combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Dynamic Visual Cryptography. This combination enables real-time attack detection that is fundamentally different from EDR approaches.

Rather than monitoring system processes via kernel drivers—which has proven unreliable in mobile environments—Interstellar provides security through TEE-embedded defense mechanisms and software-protected elements like MPC. Garbled circuits and dynamic visual cryptography further enhance security, ensuring that even on compromised devices, sensitive transactions and data remain secure.

By embedding these advanced cryptographic defenses directly into the mobile environment, Interstellar creates a decentralized firewall around each device, making it immune to many of the vulnerabilities that traditional EDR or Mobile Threats Defense (MTD) systems miss, especially on mobile platforms.

## Why Traditional EDR or MTD is Ineffective on Mobile

The limitations of traditional EDR systems are especially problematic on mobile devices, where operating systems like Android and iOS prevent the deep system access needed for full monitoring. In fact, even when allowed, EDR systems have proven fragile—such as in the 2021 CrowdStrike incident, where a driver flaw crashed millions of devices.

These limitations have left mobile endpoints—used heavily by financial institutions, enterprises, and blockchain-based applications—particularly vulnerable to APTs. With $8 trillion in global losses from cybercrime in 2023, and $1.8 to $2.5 billion annually targeting banks and blockchain, APTs represent an urgent threat.

## How Interstellar's New Category of Security Works

Interstellar’s approach is entirely different. Instead of relying on after-the-fact detection like EDR, Interstellar proactively prevents attacks using a decentralized architecture that embeds security into the devices themselves. This is achieved by combining:

- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Providing isolated, hardware-protected spaces where sensitive transactions and operations are performed securely, even if the surrounding system is compromised.
- **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Distributes sensitive tasks, such as private key signing, across multiple parties, ensuring no single point of failure. This eliminates the risks posed by centralized systems.
- **Dynamic Visual Cryptography and Garbled Circuits:** These cryptographic innovations ensure that sensitive information is presented in a form that only humans can interpret, preventing malware from capturing and manipulating transaction data.

This new approach doesn’t simply replace EDR—it transcends it. Interstellar’s security model is built on decentralized, blockchain-backed technology, where each endpoint is inherently protected by cryptographic processes and distributed verification.

## Benefits of Interstellar’s New Endpoint Defense

### Proactive and Real-Time Security

Unlike EDR systems that react to attacks, Interstellar prevents them in real-time. TEEs and MPC software-protected elements secure transactions and sensitive operations, while dynamic visual cryptography and Garbled Circuits ensure that critical data is secure even from sophisticated APTs.

### Mobile-First, Secure-First

Traditional EDR systems fail to provide deep protection on mobile devices. Interstellar's decentralized defense mechanisms work directly within the mobile ecosystem, securing even mobile endpoints from sophisticated threats without relying on OS-level drivers or external monitoring.

### Scalable and Cost-Efficient

Unlike costly centralized solutions, Interstellar’s blockchain-driven, decentralized approach scales efficiently. Whether protecting individual users, financial institutions, or large-scale enterprises, Interstellar offers superior security with a lower cost of implementation, making it a cost-effective alternative to MTD solutions that can cost up to $10 per month per device.

## Why Interstellar is the Future of Mobile Security

Interstellar is more than just a response to rising cyber threats; it represents a new way of thinking about endpoint defense. By integrating decentralized security directly into mobile devices and using blockchain-backed technology, we ensure that mobile endpoints are secured at the source—no drivers, no complex installations, no reliance on external monitoring.

In today’s world, where Binance, Microsoft, and the FBI are all warning about the growing sophistication of cyber threats, especially APTs, a traditional EDR system is no longer enough. Interstellar represents the future of mobile endpoint security, offering unprecedented protection through cutting-edge cryptography and decentralized architecture.

## Future Vision: ITS and Secure Neural Defense

Our long-term vision is to achieve information-theoretic security (ITS), enabling a level of security that could transmit information directly to the human brain. This will be made possible through a groundbreaking improvement to our Dynamic Visual Cryptography scheme.

Additionally, Interstellar’s real-time incident detection system will continue to evolve. Our vision includes the deployment of a decentralized neural network that operates with secure inputs, ensuring that attackers cannot learn or manipulate those inputs, even on compromised mobile devices.

## Why Neural Networks Are More Efficient for Cybersecurity

Neural networks focus on attacks targeting the defense system itself. They identify vulnerabilities within the security architecture and adapt to mitigate them.

By continuously learning and improving, neural networks can anticipate how attackers might exploit weak points in the security system and proactively strengthen those areas. Combined with secure inputs, garbled circuits, and MPC within TEEs, this architecture becomes inherently resilient.
