# Mobile Hardware Security

Interstellar leverages the **Secure Element (SE)** or **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** embedded in modern smartphones to generate and store a **proxy private key** that is never accessible to the OS or app layer. This proxy key enables passwordless, tamper-resistant authentication that is **compliant with FIDO2/WebAuthn elliptic curve standards** and can be integrated as a **decentralized passkey solution**.

## Compliant by Design, Stronger by Architecture
The cryptographic keys used by Interstellar are generated inside the SE and paired with **hardware attestation**. This attestation is **verified on-chain**, eliminating reliance on centralized attestation authorities or backends. Unlike centralized passkey services that store or relay keys through vendor-controlled infrastructure (e.g. Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager), Interstellar decentralizes the full lifecycle of key generation, attestation, and use.

We use elliptic curve cryptography compatible with **FIDO2/WebAuthn (e.g., P-256)** and support full compliance with the passkey standard. Interstellarâ€™s design enables the ability to **expose public keys** to WebAuthn-compatible websites or services without breaking the decentralized trust model.

## Architecture Benefits
- **Tamper resistance**: Private keys are generated in tamper-resistant hardware. Even with full root access, malware cannot extract them.
- **No key exportability**: Keys are non-exportable by design, reducing attack surface.
- **One-device-to-one-user link**: Keys are biometrically unlocked and tied to a single device, offering phishing resistance and strong user binding.
- **On-chain verification**: Unlike WebAuthn platforms that rely on centralized metadata services, Interstellar performs **decentralized, verifiable attestation**.
- **No backend dependencies**: No reliance on Apple/Google for attestation verification or passkey lifecycle management.

## WebAuthn & Passkey Compatibility
Interstellar is designed to be **interoperable** with the emerging WebAuthn ecosystem. While our focus remains on decentralized usage within Web3, our infrastructure can expose **public key credentials** that follow the FIDO/WebAuthn model.

This means Interstellar:
- **Can be used as a decentralized passkey provider**.
- Offers **stronger privacy guarantees** by eliminating vendor metadata linkage.
- Retains **secure device binding** without compromising decentralization.

## Summary
Interstellar brings the best of mobile-native security into Web3: **biometric, passwordless access**, **hardware-bound authentication**, and **on-chain attestation**. It meets and exceeds the design goals of FIDO2/WebAuthn while offering a fully decentralized alternative that can secure wallets, Dapps, and identity use cases far beyond what centralized solutions can achieve.
