# Visual Cryptography Authentication (VCA) 
### Understanding VCA for everyone

**Think of it like a special movie that only human eyes can properly see, but with some unique security features**.



## Frame Generation

Each "frame" of the movie is created by a one-time **garbled circuit** generated on the blockchain.

Garbled circuits work like secure black boxes:
- They receive encrypted random inputs
- Process them without revealing internal logic
- Output only the specific frames they‚Äôre designed to create

Every frame is cryptographically unique and **cannot** be reused.



## The Human Vision Advantage

The system uses a brain feature called **persistence of vision**:
- Your eyes retain an image for ~1/30th of a second
- When frames change rapidly (60‚Äì120 fps):
  - Your **brain merges** the sequence into one coherent image
  - **Machines only see meaningless static**

This creates a channel that **only humans** can perceive and decode.



## Why It‚Äôs Secure

All transaction data is embedded directly into the **garbled circuit**, never appearing in memory.

To compromise it, an attacker would have to:
- Capture every individual frame **perfectly**
- Know how to **reassemble them**
- Mimic the display timing **at 60‚Äì120 fps**
- Align every **pixel position** precisely

**Infeasible. Expensive. Ineffective.**



## Analogy: The Flipbook

Imagine a fast flipbook where:
- Each page is generated by a secure black box
- Each page looks like random noise
- Only the **human eye** sees the real image when flipping quickly
- Each book is **one-time use** and **randomized**


## Visual Cryptography Simulation Example

Below is a basic demonstration of **visual cryptography**.

When two same-sized images of apparently random black-and-white pixels are superimposed, the Wikipedia logo appears.

## Intestellar Case

### Dynamic Visual Cryptography

This is the way we leverage human perssistence of vision with a basic visual cryptography scheme.

The garbled circuit manages the display of consecutive random frames. This ensures that the execution of the circuit does not leak any secret information, such as the one-time code or random keyboard topology associated with the transaction. The transaction message (amount, address) is also embedded into the circuit and remains inaccessible to the attacker, preventing any modifications.
This creates a secure visual channel between the blockchain and the user


## Garbled Circuits + Human Biology = Secure UI

This secure display channel:
- Prevents **overlay attacks** and **clipper malware**
- Makes **tampering visible**
- Works even on **infected devices**
- Makes **transaction spoofing ineffective**

> **Instead of detecting malware**, it creates an environment where spoofing is useless.



## Deep Tech Advantage

 **No need for kernel access or malware detection**  
 **Secure even on compromised devices**  
 **Simpler and clearer than traditional mobile EDR solutions**

This enables **hardware-wallet level security** with nothing more than your smartphone.

#### Intesrstellar Transaction Validation Example

"A wallet's security is only as strong as its authentication system."

üëá Try it yourself:

1. Choose your device:  
   [Desktop](https://simu.interstellar.gg/3F60.html) | [Mobile](https://simu.interstellar.gg/3F60M.html)
2. Leave all fields empty and press ‚ÄúOk‚Äù
3. Take a screenshot.

>‚Üí Thanks to the human persistence of vision, your eyes and brain retain a visual impression for about 1/30 of a second (the exact time depends on the brightness of the image). So called ‚Äúvisual cryptographic shares‚Äù are generated by the Interstellar Blockchain and displayed at 60‚Äì120 frames per second on your device. This drastically disincentivizes potential attackers from building and executing fake user interfaces (so called overlay attacks) during the display session - deeming them ineffective.
