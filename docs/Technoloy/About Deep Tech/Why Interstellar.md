# Why Interstellar?

In the wake of the recent **Bybit exploit** reportedly carried out by the Lazarus APT group, and **Binance’s alert** about the growing wave of **clipper malware** targeting mobile wallets, it's become painfully clear: the current generation of wallet security is no longer enough. Most wallets and even custodial MPC services rely on centralized infrastructure or trust assumptions that advanced attackers have already proven they can bypass — through rootkits, overlay attacks, or app impersonation. Even **hardware wallets** are not immune when their companion apps run in compromised environments.

**Interstellar** was designed for this exact moment. By combining secure hardware, decentralized key orchestration, and human-auditable dynamic visual cryptography, Interstellar ensures that even on compromised devices, sensitive transactions and authentication events remain secure. It doesn’t try to detect malware — it makes **malware useless**. In a world where attackers now target the defense mechanisms themselves, Interstellar brings a **zero-trust decentralized architecture** that’s **future-ready** and battle-tested against today’s most dangerous threats.
