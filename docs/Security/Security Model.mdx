# Interstellar Security Model

This document defines the core security model of the Interstellar authentication and transaction authorization system. It is structured around a **strong adversarial model** that assumes the attacker has significant control over the mobile device and surrounding environment.

## Security Philosophy
Interstellar's security model is built to operate under the assumption that the **operating system can be compromised**. Instead of relying on malware detection, Interstellar builds cryptographic assurances into every user interaction that matters—from authentication to transaction signing—creating a secure enclave for critical actions, even in a hostile runtime environment.

Key principle: **Security must be verifiable, hardware-anchored, and human-auditable.**

## Security Layers

### 1. **Secure Element-Based Proxy Key System**
- A non-extractable private key is generated and stored inside the mobile device’s Secure Element (SE).
- All critical operations (authentication, transaction signing) are signed with this key.
- Biometric unlocking occurs inside the SE, never exposed to the OS.

**Benefits:**
- No user secrets stored in app memory or storage.
- Malware or rootkits cannot extract the private key.

### 2. **On-Chain Key Attestation and Verification**
- Each mobile SE proxy key is paired with a cryptographic attestation issued by the SE.
- The Interstellar blockchain verifies this attestation during registration and signing events.

**Benefits:**
- Only valid, hardware-bound devices can authenticate.
- Prevents impersonation or spoofed devices.

### 3. **Dynamic Visual Cryptography Authentication (VCA)**
- Transaction payload and one-time validation code are encoded as high-speed visual frames (60–120 fps).
- Frames are generated using garbled circuits on-chain.
- Only a human eye can reconstruct the content using persistence of vision.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents screen-scraping and overlay attacks.
- Protects transaction integrity from clipper malware and UI tampering.

### 4. **TEE and MPC-backed Execution for Sensitive Logic**
- Trusted Execution Environments run the core cryptographic functions (e.g., VCA rendering, MPC signing logic).
- Multi-Party Computation (MPC) distributes key management across multiple trusted nodes for higher-value accounts.
- Key shares are stored and processed within **dedicated sidechains**, ensuring isolation.
- Attacker would need to compromise multiple sidechain nodes **and** trick consensus mechanisms backed by Polkadot’s economic security model.

**Benefits:**
- No single device or actor can compromise a high-value key.
- Greatly mitigates side-channel risks.
- Makes targeted key theft economically unfeasible.

## Summary
The Interstellar security model operates on the assumption that the surrounding system is **untrusted**. By embedding authentication into hardware, decentralizing key operations, and leveraging human-only cryptographic display channels, it redefines what endpoint security means in a post-EDR era. It provides strong guarantees against a wide range of sophisticated mobile-based threats, ensuring trust without reliance on the mobile OS.
