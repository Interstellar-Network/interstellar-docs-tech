# üõ°Ô∏è Mapping Interstellar to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Overview

Interstellar is designed to defend against a wide range of adversarial threats ‚Äî not just at the cryptographic layer, but also at the **human-machine interaction layer**, where manipulation, deception, and spoofing increasingly occur.

To contextualize our security architecture within an established framework, we map Interstellar‚Äôs protections against the [MITRE ATT\&CK¬Æ Mobile and Enterprise Matrices](https://attack.mitre.org/).

This mapping clarifies how components like **Trusted Action Validation Protocol (TAVP)**, **garbled circuit rendering**, and **TEE/SE-based attestation** counter specific attack vectors ‚Äî many of which are under-addressed in legacy wallet architectures.

## Interstellar Defense Mapping Table

| MITRE Tactic          | Technique                                        | Example Threat Scenario                             | Interstellar Defense                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial Access**    | Spearphishing via Service (T1396)                | User tricked into logging in via fake wallet portal | No password or key entry; auth only via secure enclave + behavioral circuit                            |
|                       | Drive-by Compromise (T1398)                      | User taps malicious link leading to exploit chain   | Execution must pass enclave attestation + circuit-based validation; untrusted apps fail silently       |
| **Execution**         | Input Injection (T1411)                          | App injects screen taps or transaction actions      | Transactions require cognitive-human validation via garbled circuit; bots cannot bypass interaction    |
|                       | Exploitation for Privilege (T1401)               | Exploit used to escalate mobile app privileges      | Sensitive logic isolated in TEE and evaluated through circuit gate ‚Äî no app-level privilege grants     |
| **Credential Access** | Screen Capture (T1410)                           | Malware takes screenshots of validation UI          | Garbled circuit rendering makes screen content meaningless unless seen by human eye in sequence        |
|                       | Input Capture (T1411)                            | Keystroke or touch input logging                    | No credentials typed; UI and confirmation flow cryptographically bound to each session                 |
| **Defense Evasion**   | UI Spoofing (T1444)                              | Fake transaction confirmation screens               | Visual content rendered only by secure visual cryptographic circuit; attacker cannot spoof visibility  |
|                       | Masquerading (T1406)                             | App pretending to be wallet or signer               | Circuit and TEE signature must match registered signer identity; spoofed apps fail validation          |
| **Impact**            | Data Manipulation (T1491.001)                    | Attacker changes displayed transaction details      | Transaction details cryptographically bound to garbled circuit display and verified via SE attestation |
|                       | User Interface Deception (Enterprise: T1204.002) | User misled into approving malicious transaction    | Session-specific visual layer + behavioral confirmation prevent spoofed approvals                      |

## Summary of Key Mitigation Mechanisms

* **TAVP**: Converts user intent into cryptographically verifiable action signatures, invalidating fake interactions.
* **TEE + SE Attestation**: Validates secure code execution and anchors entropy; blocks malicious app-layer code paths.
* **Visual Garbled Circuit Rendering**: Ensures only real user sees the transaction message; not recordable or spoofable.
* **Behavioral Biometrics**: Adds dynamic user-specific input validation, resistant to replay and imitation.

## üîç Scope Notes

While Interstellar covers a broad set of techniques, this mapping focuses on:

* **User-side attacks** against wallet frontends, interfaces, and transaction approvals
* **Mobile platform threats** relevant to secure self-custody and dApp interaction

Future iterations of this mapping may include:

* Post-quantum threat resilience
* Deepfake and LLM-assisted social engineering
* Secure recovery protocols in adversarial environments
