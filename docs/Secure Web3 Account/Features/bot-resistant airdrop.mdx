# Bot-Resistant Asset Distribution

Interstellar enables **bot-resistant digital asset distribution** through a human-verifiable process anchored in secure mobile hardware and dynamic visual cryptography. Each wallet is tied to a real device using its Secure Element and 1:1 biometric unlock, ensuring that only real users—not scripts or emulator farms—can access and claim assets. During the claim process, users must respond to a unique visual challenge generated by the blockchain itself, making mass automation economically and technically unfeasible.

This system eliminates the vulnerabilities of traditional airdrops, where Sybil attacks and fake account farms can drain incentives with little resistance. Interstellar flips the model by validating the device and the human behind each claim—without friction or central gatekeeping. For any project distributing tokens or onboarding users, this means fewer bots, more genuine users, and stronger conversion with provable fairness.
