# Transaction Validation

When users approve a transaction with Interstellar, they’re not just signing data—they’re **visually verifying** exactly what they’re sending and to whom. This is possible thanks to a dynamic display system that shows the transaction in a form that **only the human eye** can read and validate.

Even if malware is present on the device, it cannot alter or hide the transaction details from the user. This provides a powerful last line of defense against phishing, clipper malware, and overlay attacks—giving users full confidence in every action they approve.
