# Quick & Simple Recovery

Interstellar replaces complicated seed phrase backups with modern recovery options that are **fast**, **familiar**, and **secure**. Users can restore access with a simple NFC tap, a secure file, or social recoveryâ€”without ever needing to remember or manage sensitive credentials.

This flexible, user-friendly system reduces drop-off after wallet loss or device changes and gives both new and advanced users **peace of mind**. For Dapps and wallets, it means fewer support requests and more confident users staying in your ecosystem.
