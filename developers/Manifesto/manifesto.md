# ✴️ Interstellar Manifesto
### *A Guardian Layer for Human-Machine Interaction in the Age of Adversarial AI*

---

## I. The Problem: The Human is the New Attack Surface

In an era where **malware learns your behavior**, **AI mimics your voice**, and **deepfakes replicate your face and gestures in real time**, attackers no longer need to break into systems — they break into *you*.

The boundary between what is real and what is synthetic is vanishing. And the interface between human and machine is now the **primary attack surface**.

Passwords, OTPs, and seed phrases are no match for real-time manipulation, spoofed screens, or dynamic AI-based impersonation. The last line of defense is no longer the system. It’s *you* — and today, that line is under attack.

---

## II. The Shift: From System-Centric Security to Human-Centric Trust

Our digital infrastructure has evolved — but our security models haven’t. They remain reliant on static credentials, centralized trust anchors, and easily bypassed UI elements.

Interstellar represents a shift from protecting systems to **protecting human intent** — from authenticating keys or devices to validating **cognition, presence, and behavioral integrity**.

---

## III. The Vision: A Guardian Layer Around Human Perception

We are building the **first decentralized cryptographic protection layer** around the human interface — a **Guardian Layer** that shields how you see, decide, and act in digital space.

* A **visual cryptographic filter** readable only by your perception
* A **behavioral interface** that responds to cognitive intent
* A **sensory firewall** that invalidates adversarial stimuli
* A **zero-trust validation system** that proves *you are acting freely*

This Guardian Layer is not theoretical — it is already partially implemented in our architecture. While the vision includes **future multimodal protections** (visual, audio, cognitive) possibly supported by intelligent co-agents, Interstellar’s foundation is already in place:

* Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for secure processing (MPC planned for the mainet)
* Garbled circuits for cryptographic rendering of information (only visual)
* Stateless, privacy-preserving behavioral filters (work in progress)

These layers form the **foundational components of the Guardian Layer**.

## IV. The Foundation: TAVP — Trusted Action Validation Protocol

At the heart of Interstellar lies **TAVP — Trusted Action Validation Protocol**. TAVP is a new decentralized security primitive designed to replace fragile forms of authentication with cryptographic proofs of **user intent**.

Rather than rely on passwords, centralized biometric databases, or OTPs, TAVP validates that an action — a transaction, an identity claim, a sensitive approval — was truly initiated by the real user.

TAVP combines:

* **One-time-use garbled circuits** executed on-device
* **Dynamic behavioral biometrics** encoded in cryptographic form
* **Secure Element signatures** as hardware-backed entropy sources
* **Privacy-preserving cryptographic flows** that prevent learning or imitation

The result is a **zero-trust protocol** that validates actions — not identities — using proofs that are resilient to manipulation, replay, or AI-based forgery.

---

## V. The Mission: Democratizing Human-First Security

Security should not be a luxury for enterprises. It should be available to everyone who interacts online.

We believe in:

* **Effortless onboarding** without passwords, codes, or PINs
* **User-controlled security** anchored in hardware and cryptography
* **Decentralized trust** attested on-chain
* **Resilience against adversarial AI and malware** that targets the human layer

Interstellar makes **humans the root of trust** — not the weak link.

---

## VI. The Call: Build with Us

This manifesto is a **living document** — a snapshot of a vision that’s evolving as we build.

We invite:

* Strategic partners in finance, identity, and mobile
* Deeptech funders and institutional supporters (BPI, EU Horizon)
* Researchers and developers working on secure human-AI interaction


This vision builds on the foundation laid by our current testnet milestones, which establishes the core decentralized infrastructure — including decentralized secure execution, authentication and validation flows — that leverage the unique properties of human cognition and will support the evolution toward this broader Guardian Layer architecture.



Let’s build a trust layer that stands not just against hackers — but against *cognitive manipulation*.

Let’s make **security human-first, cryptographic by design, and resilient by necessity**.

Let’s build **Interstellar**.
