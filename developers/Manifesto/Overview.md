## ✴️ Vision Manifesto (Working Draft)

As Interstellar progresses through its technical milestones, we are also defining a broader vision for how decentralized security infrastructure should evolve.

This **manifesto** outlines our long-term thesis: that security must shift from protecting systems to **protecting humans**, and that cryptographic protocols like TAVP can enable a new class of trusted human-machine interaction.

This is a **living document**, shared here to offer context to curators, partners, and ecosystem stakeholders about where we're headed — and why our approach is different.
