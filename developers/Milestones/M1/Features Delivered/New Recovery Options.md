# New Recovery Options

Interstellar replaces complicated seed phrase backups with modern recovery options that are **fast**, **familiar**, and **secure**. Users can restore access with a simple NFC tap, or secure file you can save on the cloud or elsewhere—without ever needing to remember or manually manage sensitive credentials. 

For power users, dApp team members, or enterprise users, recovery security can be further enhanced by combining multiple backup items—such as secure files and NFC tags—and configuring a threshold-based recovery policy. For example, a 2-of-3 threshold configuration might require any two of the following three backup items to restore access: two secure files and one NFC tag.

This flexible, user-friendly system reduces drop-off after wallet loss or device changes and gives both new and advanced users **peace of mind**. For Dapps and wallets, it means fewer support requests and more confident users staying in your ecosystem.
