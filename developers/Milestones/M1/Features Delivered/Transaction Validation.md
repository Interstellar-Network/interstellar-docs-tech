# Transaction or Sensitive Action Validation

When users approve a transaction or a sensistive operation with Interstellar, they’re not just signing data—they’re **visually verifying** exactly what they’re sending and to whom or the operation/action details. This is possible thanks to a dynamic display system that shows the transaction or action to approve in a form that **only the human eye** can read and validate.

Even if malware is present on the device, it cannot alter or hide the transaction details from the user. This provides a powerful last line of defense against phishing, clipper malware, and overlay attacks—giving users full confidence in every action they approve.

This framework is designed to comply with payment standard requirements like **PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)** standards, while offering enhanced protection through decentralized attestation and hardware-rooted multi-factor verification—surpassing the resilience of traditional SCA methods.
