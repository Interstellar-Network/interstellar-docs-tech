# Strong User Authentication

Interstellar uses hardware-backed biometrics already built into modern smartphones to provide **strong, invisible authentication**. Users authenticate with a fingerprint or face scan, but the actual security is enforced by a **secure chip inside the device**, never accessible to the app or operating system.

This method ensures that only the real device owner can authorize wallet accessâ€”without the need for passwords or PIN codes. For apps, it means fewer failed logins, no password resets, and a frictionless path to secure interaction with the blockchain.


:::tip
This authentication method is interoperable with the **Passkey** (WebAuthn/FIDO2) standard, while providing stronger security guarantees. By eliminating centralized key storage and enhancing resistance to phishing and malware, it offers a more resilient alternative to traditional Passkey implementations.
