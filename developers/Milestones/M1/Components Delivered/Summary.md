# Summary

This milestone delivers the core components required to support Interstellar’s secure Web3 account framework, developed as part of the testnet initiative. These components enable **passwordless onboarding**, **secure authentication**, **attested transaction validation**, and **multi-option recovery** for mobile-first users, leveraging a decentralized Substrate-based architecture.

The system’s core capabilities—such as instant user onboarding, trusted SE-based authentication, secure cloud backup via garbled circuits, and mobile-friendly recovery via NFC—are implemented through the combination of custom Substrate pallets and mobile-side logic. All features are aligned with regulatory-grade standards, such as DSP-SCA, and WebAuthn/FIDO2 while maintaining a decentralized and privacy-preserving design.

The architecture has been designed to scale across mobile apps, wallet SDK integrations, and dApps, offering a unified framework for secure account abstraction and transaction control.
