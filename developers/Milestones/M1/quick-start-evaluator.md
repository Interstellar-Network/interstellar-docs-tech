# Shortcut Path for Reviewers

If you're reviewing the milestone and prefer a fast, frictionless way to experience the delivered features â€” **without running the stack locally** â€” we recommend starting with:

### ðŸ‘‰ [Android App + Hosted Testnet](./demo-tutorial/mobile-demo-with-vps.md)

This is the most direct and reliable way to test the following:

- âœ… Account onboarding and biometric authentication
- âœ… Trusted transaction validation (TTVP)
- âœ… Secure recovery using NFC or VCA backup file

No Docker, CLI, or blockchain setup is required. Just install the demo app on an Android phone or emulator and you're ready to evaluate.

> For more technical reviewers, the full documentation provides detailed walkthroughs of runtime components, trusted execution flows, and cryptographic guarantees.
