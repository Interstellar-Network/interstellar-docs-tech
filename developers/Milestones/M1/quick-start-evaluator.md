# Shortcut Path for Reviewers

If you're reviewing Milestone 1 and prefer to start **immediately** â€” without first exploring the full documentation â€” this shortcut provides a **fast and frictionless way to experience the delivered features** without needing to run the stack locally.

It allows direct access to the core milestone logic through our mobile app, so you can validate account registration, transaction approval, the Trusted Action Validation Protocol (TAVP) and Secure recovey implementation right away.

### ðŸ‘‰ [Android App + Local Nodes](./demo-tutorial/local-demo-with-docker.md)

This is the most direct and reliable way to test the M1 features:

- âœ… Instant Account onboarding with mobile SE signature (Passkey Compliant)
- âœ… Trusted transaction validation (leveraging TAVP)
- âœ… Secure recovery using NFC or Secure (VCA-based) backup file

<!--
No Docker, CLI, or blockchain setup is required. Just install the demo app on an Android phone or emulator and you're ready to evaluate.
-->

:::note

You can return at any time to the full documentation, which offers detailed walkthroughs of the delivered features, runtime components, trusted execution flows, and cryptographic guarantees implemented in Milestone 1.
