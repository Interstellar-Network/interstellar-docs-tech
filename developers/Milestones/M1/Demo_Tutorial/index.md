# Demo Tutorial Overview

This section provides step-by-step tutorials for testing the features delivered in Milestone 1 using the Interstellar Android wallet and testnet infrastructure.

You can choose one of the following setups depending on your environment and familiarity with blockchain tooling:

1. [📱 Mobile Demo (App + Remote VPS)](./mobile-demo-with-vps.md)  
   For quick testing using the Android app and a pre-hosted blockchain node.

2. [🐳 Local Demo (Docker)](./local-demo-with-docker.md)  
   For setting up and running the full stack on your local machine via Docker.


3. [💻 Advanced CLI Demo](./advanced-cli-demo.md)  
   For command-line interaction with the TEE nodes and garbled circuit-based validation flows.
