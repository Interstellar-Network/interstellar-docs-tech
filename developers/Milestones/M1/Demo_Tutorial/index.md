You can choose one of the following setups depending on your environment and familiarity with blockchain tooling:

1. [üì± Mobile Demo (App + Remote VPS)](/developers/Milestones/M1/Demo_Tutorial/mobile-demo-with-vps.md)

2. [üê≥ Local Demo (Docker)](/developers/Milestones/M1/Demo_Tutorial/local-demo-with-docker.md)  
   For setting up and running the full stack on your local machine via Docker.


3. [üíª Advanced CLI Demo](./advanced-cli-demo.md)
