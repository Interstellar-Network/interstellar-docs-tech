# Summary

Milestone 1 focuses on delivering a subset of Interstellar’s core secure Web3 account features. These include **instant user onboarding**, along with intuitive and efficient account recovery mechanisms enabled by **instant cloud backup** and **NFC tag-based backup**.
 
Both recovery methods are designed to preserve user sovereignty by ensuring that only the user retains access to their recovery credentials, while leveraging strong cryptographic protections to maintain security and privacy at all times.

 Compared to traditional seed phrase recovery—which is often cumbersome, error-prone, and a major point of failure—Interstellar’s approach offers a more **secure** and **user-friendly** alternative that is better suited for **mainstream adoption**.
