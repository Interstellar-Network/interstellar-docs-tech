# Demo Tutorial Overview
<!--
This section guides you through testing Milestone 1 of Interstellarâ€™s secure Web3 account features. You can interact with the system using three different paths depending on your technical environment and available hardware.
:::tip Suggested Reviewer Flow

Even for technically experienced reviewers, we recommend starting with the **Android app + hosted testnet** path to evaluate the user-facing features quickly.

You can then run the **CLI + local Docker** setup to inspect runtime behavior, validate trusted extrinsics, and view node logs â€” without the additional complexity of setting up the full Android + local node stack via ADB.

## ðŸš€ Recommended: Android App with Hosted Testnet

This is the fastest way to evaluate the features delivered in Milestone 1. The Android demo app is preconfigured to connect to a remote testnet (hosted on a VPS), avoiding the need to run the blockchain stack locally.

- Requires an Android phone or emulator
- No Docker or local setup needed
- Enables full flows: onboarding, authentication, transaction validation, and recovery

:::note
The Android app connects directly to the hosted testnet. No manual configuration is required.

## ðŸ§ª Alternative/Complementary: CLI Demo with Local Docker
_(Use without a mobile device or as a runtime validation companion.)_

This method runs the entire stack locally using Docker or Podman, and allows you to test the core runtime flows via CLI scripts â€” including circuit initialization, input validation, and recovery logic.

- No mobile device required
- CLI-based validation through trusted extrinsics
- Useful for verifying backend runtime behavior independently

Each path is documented in the subsections that follow. We recommend starting with the hosted testnet unless you require deep integration testing or offline validation.

## ðŸ§± Full Stack: Android App with Local Node

This approach replicates the full mobile + node integration, running the blockchain stack locally and using the Android app to interact with it.

- Requires Android phone or emulator
- Requires local Docker or Podman setup
- Best suited for developers or reviewers who want to test the full integration stack on their own machine
