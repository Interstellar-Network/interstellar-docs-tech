# Android App with Local Nodes

This guide explains how to run the full Interstellar stack **locally** using Docker or Podman. You will be able to launch the Substrate node, Integritee TEE worker, and IPFS service, then interact with the system using the **Interstellar Android demo app**.

This setup enables full offline testing without relying on a hosted VPS.

:::info Tested Environment
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS using either Docker (docker-compose) or Podman (with manually installed podman-compose)*.
Compatibility with older distributions or alternative OSes is untested and not officially supported.

*Compose tools are required to manage service startup dependencies (e.g., health checks).
:::

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement        | Install Guide |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Docker             | [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |
| Docker Compose     | [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) |
| `curl`, `wget`, `jq` | Installed via `apt`/`brew` or default in most environments |
| Android Studio     | Optional, for emulator usage |
| ADB (`adb reverse`) | Comes with Android Studio |

> You may also use **Podman** as an alternative to Docker.

## 2. Launch the Interstellar Stack

```bash
# Step 1: Create a working directory
mkdir interstellar_m1_demo && cd interstellar_m1_demo

# Step 2: Download the stack config
curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Interstellar-Network/containers/refs/heads/add-compose/docker-compose.yml
curl -L -o docker-ipfs-init.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Interstellar-Network/containers/refs/heads/add-compose/docker-ipfs-init.sh
chmod +x docker-ipfs-init.sh

# Step 3: Start Docker (if needed)
sudo service docker start  # (for most Linux distros)

# Step 4: Launch the stack
sudo docker compose down --timeout 1 && sudo docker compose up --force-recreate
```

Wait for logs to show messages like:
```
[ocw-circuits] Hello from pallet-ocw-circuits.
ðŸ›Œ Idle (0 peers), best: #6 (...), finalized #3 (...), â¬‡ 0 â¬† 0
```


You can verify the runtime is ready using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9990)


## 3. Install the Android Demo App

### Downlaad the APK

From the official [Interstellar GitHub Release](https://github.com/Interstellar-Network/containers/releases/tag/dev1) (specific APK preconfigured to connect to `localhost`)
- `androidApp-arm64-release.apk` for Android devices or emulators on Mac M1/M2/M3
- `androidApp-x86_64-release.apk` for emulators on Windows or Mac intel

### Option 1: Physical Device

1. Transfer it to your phone
2. Allow app installation from external sources
3. Install the APK

:::info if you need more details
[How to install an APK on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185)
:::
:::warning
Ensure that your device is configured for english language
:::
### Option 2: Emulator

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. [Create](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd)  a `Pixel 7` or equivalent emulator `API 31+` - `API 35` 
3. Edit the emulator and select an API 31+ below the default API 36
<img src="/img/API35.png" alt="API 35"  width="250"/>
4. Launch the emulator
5. Drag and drop the APK onto the emulator window to install

:::info API 36 Compatibility Notice
Support for Android **API 36 is pending** due to memory alignment issues introduced with 16K page size adoption. Our low-level Rust-based garbled circuit evaluator and frame renderer currently rely on 4K alignment assumptions, leading to crashes under the new memory model. A fix is in progress
:::

---

## 2. Link App to your local Interstellar stack:

The Android app is preconfigured to connect to `localhost`
To allow the Android app to connect to your local blockchain and IPFS stack:

### Step 1: `adb reverse` SetUp
> **On** the **Desktop** connected to the **Device** or running the **Emulator** 
(Windows, Mac OS, Linux)

If Android Studio is already installed, you can enable adb in your terminal 
by adding it to your PATH with the following command (adjust the path if needed):

**Add `adb` path (windows powershell example):**
```powershell
$env:Path += ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\platform-tools"
```
>This will work for the current PowerShell session. To make it permanent, you can update your system environment variables.

**Set-up `adb reverse`**
```bash
adb reverse tcp:9944 tcp:9944   # Substrate WS
adb reverse tcp:2090 tcp:2090   # Integritee node port
adb reverse tcp:5001 tcp:5001   # IPFS

```
:::warning Troubleshooting
Make sure `adb` is properly configured and the emulator or device is detected
 with `adb devices`

 
 You can also check the reverse setup with `adb reverse --list`
:::

> This works for both emulators and real devices connected via USB or WiFi

### Step 2 (optional): `ssh` Port Forwarding 
> **On** the **System** or **VM** running the **Blockchain stack** (WSL2, Remote VM)

If the emulator is running (or the device is connected) on a different network interface than the backend 
(e.g., the backend runs in WSL2 and the Android emulator or device is connected 
via USB or Wi-Fi to Windows), 
you may need to configure port forwarding between the desktop and the blockchain.

**WSL2 ---> Windows example:**
```bash
export WSL_HOST_IP=$(ip route | awk '/default/ {print $3}')
```
```bash
ssh -N -R 9944:localhost:9944 -R 5001:localhost:5001 -R 2090:localhost:2090 [windows_user_name]@$WSL_HOST_IP
```

:::warning Troubleshooting: Firewall potential issue

To avoid issues with `ssh` or `adb reverse` during this local test, you can temporarily disable the Firewall:

**Example on Windows with PowerShell (as Administrator):**
```powershell
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Private,Public -Enabled False
```
**You can re-enable it later with:**
```powershell
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Private,Public -Enabled True
```
:::

## 4. Run the Android App Demo

### Step 1: Connect & Onboard
- Launch the app
  - Register a new mobile proxy account
  - Validate biometric & SE-based registration
- Check toasted message
  - **Registering**
  - **Registered**

### Step 2: Test Transaction Validation

- Trigger the Trusted Action Validation Protocol (TAVP) screen

Send a test transaction to a contact
<img src="/img/Send_Currency_Demo.gif" alt="wallet menu"  width="300"/>

- Enter the one-time code (2-digit), or experiment with trial/feedback
### Check Toast message order whith Action Validation Screen

- **Processing...**
- Registered
- [error] No circuits available after 10s; exiting!

[after taping one-time code digits]

- Validating transaction...
- Transaction done!
### Step 3 Test Recovery 
- Register a recovery item (e.g., NFC Item or Cloud Backup)
- Relaunch your App (simulating creation of new App)
- Recovery Screen to recover your account with your Cloud Backup and/or NFC Items


:::info Recovery Testing Note
To simplify recovery flow testing, the app generates and registers a new Secure Element (SE) key pair each time it is launched. This avoids the need to delete and reinstall the app between tests.

**Important:** Once a user registers with a specific NFC tag (or manually entered serial), they cannot register again with the same one until the backend stack is restarted (e.g., by restarting the Docker Compose setup).
:::

## Interpreting Logs

When interacting with the mobile app (e.g., authentication, transaction validation, recovery), key log messages are printed by both `integritee-node` and `integritee-service`. These logs help verify that Trusted Action flows are working as expected.

### Key messages to look for:

#### Challenge screen rendering (garbled circuit evaluation):

```
[tx-validation] store_metadata_aux: message_digits = [9, 7], pinpad_digits = [8, 4, 6, 7, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 0]
```

#### Succesful or Failed Validations (timing or incorrect code touchscreens positions)

- If you enter an invalid code:
  ```
  [tx-validation] TxFail
  ```
- If correct:
  ```
  [tx-validation] TxPass
  ```



## Optional: Front-End Access

You can inspect chain state and transactions via:

- [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9990)
- Or your preferred Substrate front-end UI

## Notes

- All services run in Docker containers and use local ports `9944`, `2090`, and `5001`
- This setup replicates the same runtime environment used in hosted testnets but fully self-contained
- Ideal for offline testing, developer evaluation, or deeper inspection of runtime logs

Next Steps:
- Try the [Advanced CLI Demo](./advanced-cli-demo.md) to interact directly with the TEE and garbled circuits logic.
