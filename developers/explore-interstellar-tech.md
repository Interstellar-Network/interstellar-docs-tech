# Explore Interstellar's Full Technology Stack

:::info
The following resources are **not required** for milestone review, but are available for reviewers and curious contributors who wish to dive deeper into Interstellar‚Äôs design, architecture, and security guarantees.

You can also find all of this content at any time via the top navigation under **"Documentation Hub."**
:::

After testing the demo and experiencing Interstellar‚Äôs secure Web3 account flows, you may want to go deeper into the system's design, security foundations, and key differentiators.

This section guides you to additional documents that explain the broader innovation behind Interstellar ‚Äî from mobile-first authentication to cryptographic protocols and compliance readiness.

## üîê Understand the Core: Mobile Security & Visual Authentication

If you're new to the concepts of secure hardware, cryptographic biometrics, and visual cryptographic authentication, start here:

- **[Mobile Security Innovations](https://interstellar-docs-tech.pages.dev/docs/Technoloy/About%20Deep%20Tech/Mobile%20Security%20Innovation)** ‚Äî How Interstellar leverages Secure Elements, biometric unlocking, and trusted execution to protect user identity and actions.
- **[Visual Cryptographic Authentication](https://interstellar-docs-tech.pages.dev/docs/Technoloy/About%20Deep%20Tech/Visual%20Cryptography%20Auhentication)** ‚Äî A readable guide to the VCA system: why randomized keypads and dynamic message displays matter for phishing resistance and regulatory alignment.

## üß† Go Deeper: Our Deep Tech Stack

Explore the cryptographic and architectural innovations behind the milestone delivery:

- **[Deep Technology Architecture](https://interstellar-docs-tech.pages.dev/docs/category/deep-technology-expertsenthusiasts)** ‚Äî Covering:
  - Mobile hardware profiling
  - Garbled circuit optimization
  - Dynamic visual cryptography
  - On-chain sybil-resistant mechanisms for asset distribution

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Threat Models

Understand how Interstellar's system is designed to withstand real-world threats:

- **[Security & Adversarial Model](https://interstellar-docs-tech.pages.dev/docs/category/security)** ‚Äî Learn about the threat model we protect against, including phishing, spoofing, malware injection, and AI-driven attacks ‚Äî and how our system architecture mitigates them by design. As part of our adversarial and defense-in-depth approach, we map key components of the Interstellar architecture to known attacker tactics and techniques, particularly those documented in the [MITRE ATT&CK Mobile](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/) and [Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/) matrices.
