# Introduction

This documentation site is specifically designed to **assist curators in reviewing and validating the milestones** associated with the development and deployment of the Interstellar testnet. These milestones pertain to the implementation of advanced **secure Web3 account features** currently under active development by Interstellar. The initial delivery of these features will be available through a **dedicated mobile wallet application**. Subsequent releases will extend support via a **mobile SDK**, enabling seamless integration for third-party wallet providers and decentralized applications (dApps) operating on mobile platforms.
